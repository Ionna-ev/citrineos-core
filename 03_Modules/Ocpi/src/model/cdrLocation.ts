/**
 * Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI) 2.2
 * The Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI) enables a scalable, automated EV roaming setup between Charge Point Operators and eMobility Service Providers. It supports authorization, charge point information exchange (including live status updates and transaction events), charge detail record exchange, remote charge point commands and the exchange of smart-charging related information between parties.
